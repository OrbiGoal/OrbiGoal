## Project Overview

Team Name: OrbiGoal

Team Members: Brian Lim Yen Sing, Li Han Lin

Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

### Foreword

Han Lin and I, both avid La Liga supporters, tuned in to an English Premier League (EPL) game one day. As the game went on, we came to a realization — we were not all that familiar with many of the players on the pitch. Sure, the star players were known to us, but beyond that, we felt out of the loop. That was when it occurred to us: wouldn't it be great to have an app that could dish out detailed player and team stats, and even make predictions about matches in leagues we're not usually glued to?

This led us to this project and to develop a football analytics app.

Our main objective is to close the gap between different leagues and equip football fans like ourselves with the knowledge and insights they need to fully appreciate the game, no matter the league they are watching. From digging into a player's performance history, and sizing up team stats, to forecasting the outcomes of future matches, we aimed to create a platform that can inform and entertain.

Additionally, we also hope to change the way fans interact with football. As we work hard to develop this application, we are also excited about the prospect of not only enhancing the football viewing experience for enthusiasts across the globe but also for the people who are new to this sport trying to get into it.

To us, this project is more than just developing an app; it is about fostering a community of like-minded football fans who share our love for the game, irrespective of their geographical or league-based boundaries!

### Aim

To engage fans on a deeper level, enhancing their football experience. We recognize the passion of current football fans and we hope that through our application, we can offer detailed match analysis, insights into team strategies, and accurate predictions for upcoming matches, elevating current fans’ engagement with football.

To attract new fans to the sport and make it more accessible to a wider audience. By designing a user-friendly interface, we can ensure that even those new to football can easily interact with the app and gain valuable insights into the game. Features such as exploring player statistics or following the latest news and updates will be made intuitive for newcomers to discover and gain excitement for football.

To bring convenience and accessibility to our users by ensuring that all users can enjoy the benefits of our app anytime, anywhere. By offering a mobile platform, users can access football analysis and insights directly from their smartphones or tablets, eliminating the need for cumbersome interfaces or repetitive Google searches.
